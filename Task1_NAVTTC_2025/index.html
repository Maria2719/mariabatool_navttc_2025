<p>Pakistan's economy ranks 24th globally by purchasing power parity (PPP) and 43rd by nominal GDP. Historically, Pakistan was part of the wealthiest region in the first millennium CE, but lost ground to regions like China and Western Europe by the 18th century.[397] Pakistan is a developing country,[398] and part of the Next Eleven, poised to become one of the world's largest economies in the 21st century, alongside the BRICS.</p>

<h5>GOVERNMENT</h5>
<p>Pakistan operates as a democratic parliamentary federal republic, with Islam designated as the state religion.[224][225] Initially adopting a constitution in 1956, Pakistan saw it suspended by Ayub Khan in 1958, replaced by a second constitution in 1962.[226] A comprehensive constitution emerged in 1973, suspended by Zia-ul-Haq in 1977 but reinstated in 1985, shaping the country's governance.[176] The military's influence in mainstream politics has been significant throughout Pakistan's history.[227] The eras of 1958–1971, 1977–1988, and 1999–2008 witnessed military coups, leading to martial law and military leaders governing de facto as presidents.[228] Presently, Pakistan operates a multi-party parliamentary system.</p>

The primary family unit is the extended family, but there's a rising trend towards nuclear families due to socio-economic factors.[579][580] Both men and women typically wear Shalwar Kameez; men also favor trousers, jeans, and shirts.[581] The middle class has grown to about 35 million, with another 17 million in the upper and upper-middle classes, leading to a shift in power from rural landowners to urban elites.[582] Festivals like Eid-ul-Fitr, Eid-ul-Azha, Ramadan, Christmas, Easter, Holi, and Diwali are primarily religious.[579] Pakistan ranks 56th on the A.T.
